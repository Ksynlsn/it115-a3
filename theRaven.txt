Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            Only this and nothing more.”


A message from Phil:
Not sure how we're going to work on this asynchronously between now and next week, but
It looks like you can @mention someone in your commit and they'll be notified.
That might be the way to notify everyone that you've made a contribution and are ready 
for the next person to branch & commit.
